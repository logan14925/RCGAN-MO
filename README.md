## Abstract

Mechanical metamaterials are engineered structures designed to exhibit unique and extraordinary mechanical properties. Traditionally, their design relied on trial-and-error methods, which are slow and limited. With the rise of machine learning, inverse design methods now provide a more efficient and systematic approach. These methods allow for a broader exploration of material properties and support the integration of multifunctionality, significantly speeding up the design process. Despite the many advantages of inverse design, lattice structures often require a trade-off between compactness and manufacturability to achieve the same target properties. Furthermore, these trade-offs must be dynamically adjusted based on different additive manufacturing conditions. To address this, we propose the RCGAN-MO architecture, which simultaneously handles the inverse design and adjustable multi-objective optimization of mechanical metamaterials. The RCGAN-MO consists of two trained neural networks: a generator and a predictor, along with a weighted multi-objective optimizer, trained on a FEM dataset. As a case study, the RCGAN-MO architecture is applied to the inverse design of the relative compressive elastic moduli  for a lattice unit cell, and the impact of different weight vector values in the multi-objective optimizer is examined through 3D printed samples. The results show that: 1) The generator achieves high accuracy in both FEM simulations and compression tests, with RÂ² values of 99.62% and 86.99%; 2) Optimizing for compactness makes the lattice unit cell harder to print, while prioritizing manufacturability improves printability, although it leads to an increase in lattice size.

## Parameter Configuration

Most hyperparameters are defined through the configuration file. If changes are needed, you can directly locate the relevant parameters in the file and modify them:

```parameter
ML\configs\nn.json
```
:exclamation: The `pth_address` in the JSON file refers to the location of the trained `.pth` model file. You can either train the model yourself by following the steps below or directly use `pre-trained models` and copy files to the `pth_address` directory.


## Training

The model definition and global variable declarations can be found at:

    ML\models\train_config.py

After tuning the training hyperparameters,

-Train the forward prediction model:
