## Abstract

Mechanical metamaterials are artificially engineered structures designed to exhibit unique and extraordinary mechanical properties. In recent years, machine learning provides a more efficient and systematic approach enabling inverse design of mechanical metamaterials, which allow for a broader exploration of material properties and support the integration of multifunctionality, significantly speeding up the design process. Despite the many advantages of inverse design, metamaterials often require a trade-off between different target properties. Furthermore, these trade-offs should be dynamically adjusted based on different additive manufacturing conditions. To address this, we proposed a regressional and conditional generative adversarial network based multi-objective (RCGAN-MO) architecture, which simultaneously handles the inverse design and adjustable multi-objective optimization of mechanical metamaterials. The RCGAN-MO consists of two trained neural networks: a generator and a predictor, along with a weighted multi-objective optimizer. As a case study, the RCGAN-MO architecture is applied to the inverse design of the relative compressive elastic modulus for a metamaterial, and metamaterials with different weight vector values in the multi-objective optimizer are achieved through 3D printed samples. This approach achieves high accuracy and could adjust the importance of manufacturability and compactness during the design of mechanical metamaterials.
